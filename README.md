# plugin-bookshelves
A plugin for Micro.blog that creates a page displaying multiple bookshelves.

If you leave the parameters untouched, the plugin generates a section for every bookshelf with headers displaying the less-than-stellar bookshelf key.

You can take these silly, lowercase, spaceless values and use them as keys for descriptions within a JSON object kinda like…

```json
{
  "currentlyreading": "*Books I am somewhat in the process of reading*",
  "finishedreading": "*Books I've managed to get myself to read*",
  "wanttoread": "*Books that gaze at me judingly from beneath the television, where they currently live, for having yet to crack their spine (f$&kers).*",
  "didwanttoread": "*Books whose gaze of judgement I've kinda become okay with as my interest in reading them has waned.*"
}
```

Notice the descriptions will be `markdownified` so you can include markdown.
 
So copy that JSON, head to the plugin parameters, and paste it in kinda like…

Then in place of those headers the plugin will generate a paragraph introducting your bookshelf with the specified description, kinda like…

You can play around with the pixel width to request for the cover images. If you do, there is something you should know:

**when you load the plugin parameter page, any previously set JSON object will be mangled, so you will want to keep it copied somewhere else and paste that little f$&ker back into the parameter field *EVERY* time you feel like actually hitting that button to update settings.**
