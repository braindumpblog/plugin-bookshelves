# plugin-bookshelves
A plugin for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog "Micro.blog") that creates a page displaying multiple bookshelves.

Once installed, the generated page will be found at `[SCHEME]://[HOSTNAME]/bookshelf/`.

If you leave the parameters untouched, the plugin generates a section for every bookshelf with headers displaying the less-than-stellar bookshelf key.

![Bookshelf Key Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonbuck/plugin-bookshelves/main/bookshelf_keys.jpeg)

You can take these silly, lowercase, spaceless values and use them as keys for descriptions within a JSON object kinda like…

```json
{
  "currentlyreading": "*Books I am somewhat in the process of reading*",
  "finishedreading": "*Books I've managed to get myself to read*",
  "wanttoread": "*Books that gaze at me judingly from beneath the television, where they currently live, for having yet to crack their spine (f$&kers).*",
  "didwanttoread": "*Books whose gaze of judgement I've kinda become okay with as my interest in reading them has waned.*"
}
```

Notice the descriptions will be `markdownified` so you can include markdown.
 
So copy that JSON, head to the plugin parameters, and paste it in kinda like…

![Plugin Parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonbuck/plugin-bookshelves/main/plugin_parameters.jpeg)

Then in place of those headers the plugin will generate a paragraph introducting your bookshelf with the specified description, kinda like…

![Bookshelf Descriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonbuck/plugin-bookshelves/main/bookshelf_descriptions.jpeg)

You can play around with the pixel width used in cover image requests. If you do, there is something you should know:

**when you load the plugin parameter page, any previously set JSON object will be mangled, so you will want to keep it copied somewhere else and paste that little f$&ker back into the parameter field *EVERY* time you feel like actually hitting that button to update settings.**

The page template lives at `layouts/bookshelf/single.html`. 

```Hugo
{{ define "main" }}
<section id="wrapper">
<article class="h-entry post">
<section class="e-content post-body">

{{ with site.Params.bookshelves_data_json }}
  {{ with transform.Unmarshal . }}
    {{ range $bookshelf, $description := . }}
    
<p class="bookshelf-description">{{ $description | markdownify }}</p>
<div class="bookshelf-books">
      {{ range index site.Data.bookshelves $bookshelf }}

{{ partial "book.html" . }}

      {{ end }}
</div>

    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

{{ else }}
  
 {{ range $bookshelf_key, $bookshelf := site.Data.bookshelves }}
 
<h1 class="bookshelf-key">{{ $bookshelf_key }}</h1>
<div class="bookshelf-books">
  {{ range $bookshelf }}
  
{{ partial "book.html" . }}  
  
  {{ end }}
</div>

 {{ end }}

{{ end }}

</section>
</article>
</section>

{{ end }}
```

The partial it uses for each book lives at `layouts/partials/book.html`. It may be useful elsewhere if you feed it a book from a bookshelf.

```Hugo
{{ $cover_width := 100 }}
{{ with site.Params.bookshelves_cover_width }}
{{ $cover_width = . | int }}
{{ end }}
<div class="bookshelf-book">
  <a 
    class="bookshelf-book-link" 
    href="https://micro.blog/books/{{ .isbn }}">
    <img 
      class="bookshelf-book-cover"
      src="https://micro.blog/photos/{{ $cover_width }}x/{{ .cover_url }}"
      align="left" />
  </a>
  <div>
  <span class="bookshelf-book-title">{{ .title }}</span>
{{ with .author }}
  <br /><span class="bookshelf-book-author">by {{.}}</span>
{{ end }}
  </div>
 </div>
```

The HTML elements are all appropriately classed for custom CSS, etc., etc. The stylesheet it uses lives at `static/assets/css/bookshelf.css`.

```css
div.bookshelf-books {
  margin: 50px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 20px;
}

div.bookshelf-book {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

The file living at `content/bookshelf.md` specifies the front matter for the page.

```json
{
  "title": "Bookshelf",
  "description": "Book collections",
  "type": "bookshelf",
  "menu": {
    "main": {
      "name": "Bookshelf",
      "title": "Bookshelf",
      "identifier": "bookshelf",
      "url": "/bookshelf/",
      "weight": 115
    }
  }
}
```

Leave the `type` alone (as that is what points it to `layouts/bookshelf/single.html`). You can play with the `title` and `description` values. These set the values I would expect your theme to draw from when constructing the page `<head>`. The `menu` creates a menu item to include the page in your navigation. Leave the `url` alone (this is how the link’s target is derived). You can play around with the other values. You can adjust the value of `weight` to slide the menu item up or down your list of navigation items. You can remove the `menu` entry entirely if you do not want the page to show up in your navigation menu.
